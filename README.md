# Numerical-Method-Algorithms README
This repository contains algorithms created throughout the course of MECH 105 at Colorado State University (2018). They represent ways to find the roots of functions, decompose matrices, and evaluate numerical integrals of functions. The assignment of these algorithms furthered our understanding of numerical methods and taught us how to "think like a computer."
## Algorithms
### False Position
The False Position algorithm estimates the root of a function using the False Position method.
### luFactor
The luFactor algorithm decomposes a square matrix into an upper and lower matrix.
### Simpson
The Simpson algorithm integrates experimental data points using the Simpson's 1/3 method with application of the trapezoidal rule if required.
