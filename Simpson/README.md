# Simpson
The Simpson Methods are used to numerically evaluate integrals for 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3 <sup>rd</sup> order polynomials. There are two variations of the Simpson's rule: Simpson's 1/3 Rule and Simpson's 3/8 Rule. Simpson's 1/3 rule is ideal when there are an even number of segments while Simpson's 3/8 rule is ideal for an odd number of segments. This algorithm uses Simpson's 1/3 rule and utilizes the trapezoidal rule if there are an odd number of segments.
## How it Works
Simpson's 1/3 rule connects an odd number of evenly spaced points along the function to create an even number of segments under the curve. The area under
